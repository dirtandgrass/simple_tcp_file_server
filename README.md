# File Server

This is a Node.js project that serves files over a network using a simple server-client architecture.

## Instructions for Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`.
3. Start the server: `node serve.js`.
4. The server is now running and ready to serve files.

## Server

The server is located in the `server` directory. The main entry point is `serve.js`. This script starts the server and listens for incoming requests. You can modify the server configuration in this file to suit your needs.

## Test Client

A test client is provided in the `client` directory. This client can be used to send requests to the server and test its functionality. To use the test client:

1. Navigate to the `client` directory: `cd client`.
2. Start the client: `node test-client.js`.
3. The client will send requests to the server and display the responses.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your requirements.
